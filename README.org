We introduce /I see you/ a vehicle-pedestrian trajectory dataset for pedestrian trajectory prediction in near-miss situations, autonomous driving safety analysis, pedestrian safety hazard evaluation.

We collected vehicle and pedestrian trajectories in near-accident scenarios from surveillance cameras at signalized intersections.

For each interaction we provide:
+ Processed vehicle and pedestrian trajectories in GPS coordinates.
+ Vehicle-pedestrian ids
+ Frame
+ Video clip

The trajectories are provided in the following format

| clip | id | frame | latitude | longitude |

Pedestrian trajectories can be found [[./Results/1_06_37_00_ped.csv][here]] and vehicle trajectories [[./Results/1_06_37_00_veh.csv][here]]. Time is expressed as frame(FPS=30).

Also individual GPS trajectories (for each pedestrian and vehicle) can be found [[./Results/trajectories_gps/][here]] (easy visualization using google maps!)
