We introduce /I see you/ a vehicle-pedestrian trajectory dataset for pedestrian trajectory prediction in near-miss situations, autonomous driving safety analysis, pedestrian safety hazard evaluation.

We collected vehicle and pedestrian trajectories in near-accident scenarios from surveillance cameras at signalized intersections.

** Dangerous Interaction

** Non-Dangerous Interaction

For each interaction we provide:
+ Processed vehicle and pedestrian trajectories in GPS coordinates.
+ Vehicle-pedestrian ids
+ Frame
+ Video clip

The trajectories are provided in the following format

| clip | id | frame | latitude | longitude |

Pedestrian trajectories can be found [[./Results/1_06_37_00_ped.csv][here]] and vehicle trajectories [[./Results/1_06_37_00_veh.csv][here]]. Time is expressed as frame(FPS=30).

You can visualize each interaction trajectories using [[https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024836?hl=en&ref_topic=3024924#zippy=%2Cstep-import-info-into-the-map][google maps]]. Individual GPS trajectories can be found [[./Results/trajectories_gps/][here]] (/_ped/ files correspond to pedestrian trajectories and /_veh/ correspond to vehicle trajectories, /_ped/ and /_veh/ files that belong to the same interaction have the same clip name /clip_name_veh,clip_name_ped/)

Bellow are the speed distributions for our dataset as well as number of interactions by type of interaction(refer to our paper for more information).

| Scenario      | Number of Occurrences |
| Dangerous     |                   91 |
| Non-Dangerous |                   79 |

Video clips can be found at google drive.
